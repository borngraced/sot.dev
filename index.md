I'm a self-taught systems engineer with 7 years of experience building blockchain infrastructure and high-performance software. I work primarily with Rust, Golang, and C, focusing on microservices, protocol implementation, WebAssembly integrations, and performance optimization.

My work involves implementing complex blockchain protocols and making them work in challenging environments. I pioneered the first WebAssembly implementation of the Zcash protocol, enabling privacy-focused cryptocurrency transactions directly in web browsers. I've also integrated complete protocol specifications like WalletConnect v2 for secure wallet connections, and delivered significant performance improvements, including a 7.9x speedup in Ethereum VM implementations.

Currently, I'm a Rust Software Engineer at Komodo Platform, where I build decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and contribute to the core infrastructure that powers cross-chain trading. When I'm not writing code, I'm actively contributing to open-source projects.
